# Part 11: Summary

That's the end of our Container workshops using Docker!

In summary, Docker's functionality falls into several catergories:

- Portable deployment of applications as a single object
- Simplifying Configuration
- Reusable components
- App isolation
- Public registry for sharing containers
- A growing tools ecosystem from the published API

We've learnt:
- How to run an application in a Docker container
- How to create our own `Dockerfile`
- Docker Architecture
- Docker CLI tips

Useful links for further info:
- [Docker API docs](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Namespaces and cgroups](https://medium.com/@nagarwal/understanding-the-docker-internals-7ccb052ce9fe)
- [Katacoda Container tutorials](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/docker)


We will shortly be moving onto Container Orchestration, with a short workshop on using Kubernetes.
