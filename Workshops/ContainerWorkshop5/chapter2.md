### Devops

#### The traditional approach
Previously, most companies separated their software teams into developers, testers, system administrators, and so on.
Lack of communication and division of knowledge would often result in a slow down of the delivery of a project.

Suppose a developer added a new feature, they would then have to send it to the testing team for review. After the review, the
application would be built, and then finally, another team would pick it up to deploy the feature and roll it back in the
case of an error. This approach is time consuming and prone to error due to lack of understanding of the project as a whole.

#### A new approach
The Devops culture instead advocates for software developers to be involved in the entire delivery process. The main
advantage of this approach is reducing the time it takes from the inception of the software to its delivery. The separation 
between teams is reduced, as both developers and administrators share the same tools and are expected to know how to:

- Write and test the code for each component
- Build the entire project
- Secure it
- Deploy it
- Maintain it
- Monitor it

Both Devops and Agile concentrate on automation and continuous integration and delivery. Continuous integration and delivery
is a software engineering approach in which the features of a product are incrementally developed, tested, and deployed.
The advantage of this is that the time it takes to integrate and test large features is reduced as the features are broken down
more granularly. A secondary advantage is that quality assurance is being done often, resulting in early feedback, and therefore
improves customer satisfaction. With the advent of Kubernetes, practicing a Devops methodology has become a lot easier.
Developers can write, test, roll out, and roll back features if necessary, all in one day.
