# WHCHelsinkiWorkshop

Welcome to the WHC Finland Container Workshop! 

If you look at Docker and Containers, one of the reasons why it's had such success over the six years is that the community is so active and willing to share knowledge. Just like today, with all of you attending this workshop! With that in mind, over the next few hours, we're going to do our bit to share knowledge on containers.
