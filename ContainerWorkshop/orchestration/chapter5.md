### Kubernetes Architecture

We're now going to go through a few concepts about the Kubernetes architecture which we have brushed over previously.

Kubernetes is composed by primitives, we have previously learned about:

- Pods - collections of containers which share the same IP address
- Nodes - machines on which multiple pods may live
- Clusters - collections of nodes
- Services - enable access to the previous three objects
- Deployments - enable creation of Pods and ReplicaSets

#### Kubectl

In order to interact with these objects you must be able to communicate with the Kubernetes API. The typical way
to interact with the API is by using the command-line interface **kubectl**. 

#### KubeDNs

#### Controllers

Controllers are a t
#### etcd
#### kubeadm
